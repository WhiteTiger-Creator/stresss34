# Pager-Policy Rollout Review Log
Mercury Payments Ops — change-advisory archive for the failed pager-policy rollout (2026-Q1 through 2026-Q2).

## Executive Summary
The sample routing compiler has produced unsafe responder queues since the February rollout. How the compile is *meant* to behave — normalization, dedupe and its tie-breaks, interval and overlap semantics, domain ordering, policy resolution, attenuation, the responder debt ledger, unit and threshold math, scoring, priority and queue ordering — was settled incrementally by the change-advisory board, and those decisions live in the review entries below, not in any single summary. The February draft proposals were revisited during the 2026-05 review cycle and several were reversed; where a draft proposal and a later CAB decision disagree, the later decision governs. `/app/docs/rollup_contract.json` is the output contract only: it fixes file paths, schemas, exact key sets, identifier payloads and checksum encodings, not how the values are derived.

## February Draft Proposals (2026-02 — partly reversed)
The initial rollout draft circulated a set of compile-behavior proposals through CAB tickets in the 1900 range. Several did not survive review. They are archived in place below and marked superseded; do not implement them as written.

## Change-Review Archive (2025-Q4 through 2026-Q2)

> **Rollout draft proposal (2026-02-27 - MET-1932)** Tomas: escalation_score should weight debt_adjusted_dispatchable_ms // 50, sample_count once, critical_sample_count twice, and count each pressure score a single time rather than doubling any of them *(Superseded — reversed in the 2026-05 change review; see the matching decision entry.)*

> **Rollout draft proposal (2026-02-28 - MET-1934)** Tomas: queue admission thresholds — compute `effective_queue_min_ms = queue_min_effective_ms + suppress_units*suppress_penalty_ms - boost_units*boost_credit_ms` with no floor at that step, add the handoff, blackout and degrade unit penalties in turn, and apply the `min_queue_floor_ms` floor once at the very end to the final `dispatch_queue_min_ms` *(Superseded — reversed in the 2026-05 change review; see the matching decision entry.)*

> **Change-review decision (2026-04-22 - MET-2131)** Tomas: scoped handoff/blackout/degrade overlap_ms is the SUM of the (service, all) clipped duration and the (service, max_severity) clipped duration, and segment_count is the total count of clips across both scopes; the two scopes are not unioned. *(Revised — see the 2026-05 change review.)*
> **Change-review decision (2026-04-24 - MET-2133)** Tomas: where a suppress span and a boost span intersect, the shared duration counts toward suppression_overlap_ms and is excluded from boost_overlap_ms; suppress wins the intersection. *(Revised — see the 2026-05 change review.)*

Historical CSV escalation exports remain archived and non-authoritative for the JSON compile acceptance.
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-02 - MET-2201)** Ilya: canonical service labels are trimmed and lowercased, then folded through the alias table: `authentication` -> `auth`, `payments` -> `billing`, `search-api` -> `search`. This supersedes MET-1903.

### Review entry 0812 — debt bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-16 - MET-2242)** Ilya: the debt credit applied to the dispatchable duration was losing every partial step, so a debt carry smaller than one full step credited nothing. That credit now ROUNDS UP: `debt_adjusted_dispatchable_ms = dispatchable_billable_duration_ms + ceil(debt_in_ms / 5)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/5) is -(-x // 5). The `// 3` idle decay and the debt_out cap recorded earlier are unchanged and still round down. This revises the floored credit in MET-2236.

### Review entry 0816 — probe bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-17 - MET-2246)** Dana: the blackout probe takes the same correction and no other: `blackout_pressure_score = (blackout_all_probe_ms // 36) + ceil(blackout_severity_probe_ms / 24) + blackout_segment_count`. The degrade probe was reviewed in the same session and is deliberately left floored on both halves, so the two must not be assumed symmetric.

### Review entry 0818 — debt bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-17 - MET-2248)** Ilya: the debt-in half of the debt pressure score ROUNDS UP while the debt-out half does not: `debt_pressure_score = (debt_out_ms // 80) + ceil(debt_in_ms / 120)`. The 80 debt-out divisor is unchanged.

### Review entry 0821 — canonicalization bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-18 - MET-2258)** Marta: duplicate-severity precedence is REVERSED. Incident reports that duplicate an existing `sample_id` frequently arrive from an automated escalator that inflates severity before a human has confirmed it, so taking the maximum severity was systematically over-escalating the queue. Where two rows share an `sample_id` and tie on `end_ms`, the row with the LOWER severity rank is now the one kept — minor beats major, major beats critical. The remaining keys of the MET-2207 chain are unchanged and still run in the same order after this one: then prefer `planned == false`, then max `start_ms`, then max `service` lexicographically. Only the severity comparison direction changes. This reverses that step of MET-2207.

### Review entry 0822 — routing bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-19 - MET-2252)** Dana: handoff attenuation review found a scoped handoff overlap shorter than one full step was being absorbed without cost, so the handoff subtraction ROUNDS UP: `adjusted_billable_duration_ms = max(billable_duration_ms - ceil(handoff_overlap_ms / 2), 0)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/2) is -(-x // 2). This revises the floored form recorded in MET-2208.

### Review entry 0824 — routing bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-19 - MET-2254)** Dana: the blackout attenuation takes the same correction: `routed_billable_duration_ms = max(adjusted_billable_duration_ms - ceil(blackout_overlap_ms / 3), 0)`. The degrade attenuation that follows it was reviewed in the same session and is deliberately left FLOORED at `degrade_overlap_ms // 4`, so the three attenuation layers must not be assumed to round alike.

### Review entry 0826 — exception bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-20 - MET-2256)** Ilya: boost units are counted the same way suppression units already are — `boost_units = ceil(boost_overlap_ms / boost_unit_ms)` — because a partial boost window was previously granting no credit at all. The handoff, blackout and degrade unit counts keep their floors and are not affected by this entry.

### Review entry 0820 — audit bench
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-18 - MET-2250)** Ilya: recording the rounding map settled across MET-2224, MET-2242, MET-2246, MET-2248, MET-2252, MET-2254 and MET-2256 for the avoidance of doubt. Rounding in this compiler is NOT uniform and no divisor's direction may be inferred from any other, including between siblings in the same family: the suppression unit count and the four probe/unit families each carry their own direction, and the degrade and handoff probes stay floored where the blackout probe rounds up. Read each divisor's direction from its own governing decision. *(Revised on the degrade probe point — see MET-2264.)*

> **Change-review decision (2026-05-03 - MET-2205)** Priya: `planned` coercion: booleans — preserve the boolean value; strings — strip and lowercase; true, 1, and yes become true; every other string becomes false; other types — use Python bool(value): null and numeric 0 become false; nonzero numbers and other truthy values become true.

> **Change-review decision (2026-05-16 - MET-2236)** Marta: closing the extended-quiet thread from the 0491 review — proportional decay leaves stale debt on the books when a service goes quiet for a long stretch, so the ledger now resets outright past a threshold: when `idle_gap_ms` is 600 or greater, `debt_in_ms` is 0 for that window instead of `max(previous.debt_out_ms - (idle_gap_ms // 3), 0)`.

> **Change-review decision (2026-05-18 - MET-2251)** Marta: the maintenance-window review closed on this lane with one ledger change — a window that overlapped planned maintenance still leaves residual responder debt, and carrying nothing for it understated the next window's position. Each maintenance span now carries a credit alongside the existing ones: `debt_out_ms = min(debt_in_ms + dispatchable_billable_duration_ms + maintenance_span_count*12 + handoff_segment_count*20 + blackout_segment_count*25 + degrade_segment_count*15, 2500)`.

## Communications Retro — Rollout Incident (filed 2026-05-29)
The comms retro examined how decisions traveled during the rollout sample, because two early misimplementations traced to engineers acting on chat summaries rather than ticketed CAB decisions. The board's decisions were consistently correct at the ticket level, but paraphrases posted to the sample channel dropped qualifiers — most notably scope restrictions — and those paraphrases were what several implementers read. Three practices were adopted. First, decision announcements in chat must link the ticket and quote its operative sentence verbatim, with paraphrase labeled non-authoritative. Second, the weekly digest pilots a superseded-by column so anyone skimming can see which February drafts and later-revised interim positions were overturned without reconstructing the chain by hand. Third, the sample channel's pinned post now states the reading rule that governs this archive: where an earlier proposal and a later decision disagree, the later decision governs, and the ticketed record — not chat — is the source of truth. The retro reaffirmed that no communications practice changes compile semantics; the tickets remain the only mechanism by which behavior changes.


> **Change-review decision (2026-05-25 - MET-2240)** Priya: responder dashboards retain ninety days of window history; older windows are served from the artifact archive on demand. Dashboard retention is an operational setting and carries no weight in compile output.

> **Change-review decision (2026-05-28 - MET-2243)** Marta: artifact bundles must record output signatures at export time and again at archive ingest; a mismatch quarantines the bundle for manual review. Evidence handling only; artifact contents are unaffected.

## Q2 Tabletop Exercise — Minutes (2026-06-04)
The quarterly tabletop walked the sample-to-responder path end to end with the compiler treated as a black box: a synthetic sample burst was injected into a staging replica and each lane's on-call narrated their actions from the artifacts alone. Facilitators stopped the clock four times. The first stop tested whether responders could distinguish a suppressed window from a queued one using only the queue artifact and the runbook; every lane answered correctly, though two took over five minutes, and the board asked for a one-page reading guide rather than any change to the artifacts. The second stop simulated a stale dashboard during an active page; the on-call correctly fell back to the queue file on disk, noted as intended behavior since the dashboard is a projection, never the record. The third stop was a deliberately misrouted escalation where the paged lane did not own the affected service; the handoff completed in under two minutes using the escalation tree verified in prep. The final stop rehearsed evidence preservation: responders exported the queue and summary artifacts, recorded their signatures in the sample channel, and confirmed the frozen snapshot remained untouched. Action items: publish the reading guide, add the signature-recording step to the runbook appendix, and repeat with the secondary pool as primary. The board minuted explicitly that no action item touches compile behavior; all semantics remain exactly as ticketed.


> **Change-review decision (2026-06-03 - MET-2262)** Dana: quarterly access recertification for the routing path samples service-to-service grants at twice the standard rate through year end. Access policy; no compiler impact.
> **Change-review decision (2026-05-30 - MET-2264)** Marta: degrade probe rounding, and the rounding map of record. The SEVERITY-scoped half of the degrade probe now ROUNDS UP (ceiling) while the all-scoped half keeps its floor: `degrade_pressure_score = (degrade_all_probe_ms // 34) + ceil(degrade_severity_probe_ms / 23) + degrade_segment_count`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/23) is -(-x // 23). This revises the floored `degrade_severity_probe_ms // 23` written in MET-2227, which is superseded on this point only: the probe range [end_ms-210, end_ms+1), the divisors 34 and 23, the all-scoped floor and the segment term are unchanged. This entry also supersedes MET-2250 as the rounding map of record: rounding remains NON-uniform and no divisor's direction may be inferred from any other, but the degrade probe no longer stays floored on both halves — only the handoff probe does. Read each divisor's direction from its own governing decision.

## Access Review Appendix — 2026-06 Cycle
The June access review covered every principal with write access to the routing path. The rollout-era automation account remained disabled with credentials expired and no login attempts since containment; the artifact bucket's writer list matched the roster after one contractor account was removed at engagement end; the dashboard service account retained read-only scopes with token rotation verified against the ninety-day policy; and the break-glass account passed its quarterly seal check, countersigned by two leads. One follow-up: a legacy CI role carried a stale policy attachment referencing the pre-rollout compiler path — no active trust relationships, removed same day through the standard change process. Ten sampled permission grants from the quarter all carried ticket references and approver signatures. The board accepted the appendix without dissent and doubled the service-to-service sampling rate for next cycle as a precaution following the rollout sample. Nothing in this appendix modifies how the compiler computes, admits, or orders responder work.

## Worked examples — illustrative only (they restate the final governing rules and introduce nothing new)

The rules below are already fixed by the ticketed decisions above; these traces use **invented inputs** to make the error-prone, mixed-rounding steps concrete so an implementation can be checked one step at a time. They add no rule and disclose no output value; each step cites the decision that governs it. In integer arithmetic `ceil(x/n) = -(-x // n)` and `floor(x/n) = x // n`.

### A. Attenuation chain on a single sample window (MET-2216, as revised by MET-2252 and MET-2254)
Inputs: `duration_ms=1000`, `maintenance_overlap_ms=120`, `handoff_overlap_ms=7`, `blackout_overlap_ms=10`, `degrade_overlap_ms=9`.
- `billable_duration_ms              = max(1000 - 120, 0)         = 880`
- `adjusted_billable_duration_ms     = max(880 - ceil(7/2), 0)   = max(880 - 4, 0) = 876`   — handoff ÷2 **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2252)
- `routed_billable_duration_ms       = max(876 - ceil(10/3), 0)  = max(876 - 4, 0) = 872`   — blackout ÷3 **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2254)
- `dispatchable_billable_duration_ms = max(872 - floor(9/4), 0)  = max(872 - 2, 0) = 870`   — degrade ÷4 stays **FLOORED** (MET-2254)

### B. Debt ledger across a service's sample windows (MET-2219, as revised by MET-2236, MET-2242 and MET-2251)
State is per normalized service; windows are processed in `start_ms` ascending order after all attenuation fields are final. The first window has `idle_gap_ms=0`, `debt_in_ms=0`. Take a later window **B** whose predecessor finalized `debt_out_ms=300`, with `idle_gap_ms=90`, `dispatchable_billable_duration_ms=500`, `maintenance_span_count=1`, `handoff_segment_count=2`, `blackout_segment_count=0`, `degrade_segment_count=1`:
- `idle_gap 90 < 600`, so `debt_in_ms = max(300 - floor(90/3), 0) = max(300 - 30, 0) = 270`   — idle decay ÷3 **FLOOR** (MET-2219)
- `debt_adjusted_dispatchable_ms = 500 + ceil(270/5) = 500 + 54 = 554`                        — debt credit ÷5 **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2242)
- `debt_out_ms = min(270 + 500 + 1*12 + 2*20 + 0*25 + 1*15, 2500) = min(837, 2500) = 837`     — maintenance-span credit 12 (MET-2251); handoff/blackout/degrade segment credits 20/25/15 and the 2500 cap (MET-2219)

Then a following window **C** with `idle_gap_ms=600`:
- `idle_gap 600 >= 600`, so `debt_in_ms = 0` **outright** — the ÷3 decay does NOT apply; the ledger resets past the threshold (MET-2236).

### C. Unit conversions (MET-2224, as revised by MET-2256)
With `suppress_unit_ms=50`, `boost_unit_ms=50`, `handoff_unit_ms=60`:
- `suppress_overlap_ms=70 → suppress_units = ceil(70/50) = 2`  — suppress **ROUNDS UP** (and `suppress_units=0` whenever the suppress overlap is 0)
- `boost_overlap_ms=70    → boost_units    = ceil(70/50) = 2`  — boost **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2256)
- `handoff_overlap_ms=70  → handoff_units  = floor(70/60) = 1` — handoff, blackout and degrade unit counts stay **FLOORED**

### D. Scoped overlap is a UNION of the two scopes, not their sum (MET-2213)
Sample window `[200, 500)`. Compacted `(service, all)` interval `[180, 240)`; compacted `(service, max_severity)` interval `[240, 300)`.
- clip each to the window: `(all) → [200, 240)` length 40; `(severity) → [240, 300)` length 60.
- union and compact the two clips with the touching-merge rule: `[200, 240)` and `[240, 300)` touch at 240 → they merge into `[200, 300)`.
- therefore `overlap_ms = 100` and `segment_count = 1` — **not** overlap `40 + 60` with `segment_count = 2`.

### E. Which queue value the sample_signature carries (see `rollup_contract.json` sample_signature payload)
The signature payload carries `effective_queue_min_ms` — the profile's `queue_min_effective_ms` after the suppress/boost **unit** penalties and credits — then `adjusted_queue_min_ms`, then (after the handoff and blackout unit penalties) `routed_queue_min_ms`, then `dispatch_queue_min_ms`. It does **not** carry `policy_queue_min_ms` (the pre-penalty profile value), even though that value is also emitted as its own row field. Read the exact field list and order from the contract's `sample_signature` payload string.

### F. Probe pressure scores round PER HALF, and the three families do not agree (MET-2227, as revised by MET-2246 and MET-2264)
Each pressure score adds an all-scoped probe term, a severity-scoped probe term, and the domain's segment count. The divisors and, critically, the ROUNDING DIRECTION of each half are per-domain — read them from the governing decision, never by analogy to another family. The all-scoped half is FLOORED in all three families; the severity-scoped half is FLOORED for handoff but ROUNDS UP for blackout and degrade.
Inputs (already-computed probe overlaps, in ms): handoff `all=65, severity=45, handoff_segment_count=1`; blackout `all=80, severity=50, blackout_segment_count=2`; degrade `all=70, severity=47, degrade_segment_count=0`.
- `handoff_pressure_score  = floor(65/30) + floor(45/20) + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`   — BOTH halves **FLOOR** (MET-2227; handoff is the one family left floored on both halves, per MET-2264's map)
- `blackout_pressure_score = floor(80/36) + ceil(50/24)  + 2 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7`   — all-scoped **FLOOR**, severity-scoped **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2246); note `ceil(50/24)=3`, a floor would have given 2
- `degrade_pressure_score  = floor(70/34) + ceil(47/23)  + 0 = 2 + 3 + 0 = 5`   — all-scoped **FLOOR**, severity-scoped **ROUNDS UP** (MET-2264); note `ceil(47/23)=3`, a floor would have given 2
The probe overlaps come from the half-open probe ranges in MET-2227 (handoff `[end_ms-180, end_ms+1)`, blackout `[end_ms-240, end_ms+1)`, degrade `[end_ms-210, end_ms+1)`) measured against the compacted intervals — the same union-then-measure method as example D.
